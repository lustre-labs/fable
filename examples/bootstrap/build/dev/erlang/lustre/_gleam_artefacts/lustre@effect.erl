    " In other frameworks it's common for components to perform side effects\n"
    " whenever the need them. An event handler might make an HTTP request, or a\n"
    " component might reach into the DOM to focus an input.\n"
    "\n"
    " In Lustre we try to keep side effects separate from our main program loop.\n"
    " This comes with a whole bunch of benefits like making it easier to test and\n"
    " reason about our code, making it possible to implement time-travel debugging,\n"
    " or even to run our app on the server using Lustre's server components. This\n"
    " is great but we still need to perform side effects at some point, so how do\n"
    " we do that?\n"
    "\n"
    " The answer is through the `Effect` type that treats side effects as *data*.\n"
    " This approach is known as having **managed effects**: you pass data that\n"
    " describes a side effect to Lustre's runtime and it takes care of performing\n"
    " that effect and potentially sending messages back to your program for you.\n"
    " By going through this abstraction we discourage side effects from being\n"
    " performed in the middle of our program.\n"
    "\n"
    " ## Related packages\n"
    "\n"
    " While Lustre doesn't include many built-in effects, there are a number of\n"
    " community packages define useful common effects for your applications.\n"
    "\n"
    " - [`rsvp`](https://hexdocs.pm/rsvp) – Send HTTP requests from Lustre\n"
    "   applications and server components.\n"
    "\n"
    " - [`modem`](https://hexdocs.pm/modem) – A friendly Lustre package to help\n"
    "   you build a router, handle links, and manage URLs.\n"
    "\n"
    "  - [`plinth`](https://hexdocs.pm/plinth) – Bindings to Node.js and browser\n"
    "    platform APIs. (This package does not include any effects directly, but\n"
    "    it does provide bindings to many APIs that you can use to create your\n"
    "    own.)\n"
    "\n"
    " ## Examples\n"
    "\n"
    " For folks coming from other languages (or other Gleam code!) where side\n"
    " effects are often performed in-place, this can feel a bit strange. We have\n"
    " a category of example apps dedicated to showing various effects in action:\n"
    "\n"
    " - [HTTP requests](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre/tree/main/examples/03-effects/01-http-requests)\n"
    "\n"
    " - [Generating random values](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre/tree/main/examples/03-effects/02-random)\n"
    "\n"
    " - [Setting up timers](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre/tree/main/examples/03-effects/03-timers)\n"
    "\n"
    " - [Working with LocalStorage](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre/tree/main/examples/03-effects/04-local-storage)\n"
    "\n"
    " - [Reading from the DOM](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre/tree/main/examples/03-effects/05-dom-effects)\n"
    "\n"
    " - [Optimistic state updates](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre/tree/main/examples/03-effects/06-optimistic-requests)\n"
    "\n"
    " This list of examples is likely to grow over time, so be sure to check back\n"
    " every now and then to see what's new!\n"
    "\n"
    " ## Getting help\n"
    "\n"
    " If you're having trouble with Lustre or not sure what the right way to do\n"
    " something is, the best place to get help is the [Gleam Discord server](https://discord.gg/Fm8Pwmy).\n"
    " You could also open an issue on the [Lustre GitHub repository](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre/issues).\n"
